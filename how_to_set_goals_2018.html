                    <h4 class="section-subheading">(Or, the framework of how I set goals for 2018)</h4>

                    <p>Goal setting is hard. Over the years, I set goals in January and failed at them by March. It&#8217;s difficult to set a good goal, follow through, and achieve it. </p>

                    <p>This last year, I put a lot of effort into learning how to set goals and accomplish them. Here is the current framework I use for approaching goal setting in 2018. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Framework to Create Good Goals</h2>

                    <p>I go back and forth with the word “goals”. And don’t get me started on resolutions! Goals can implicitly imply unhappiness until achievement, then after you achieve the goal you can feel lost because I do not have anything to aim for anymore. </p>

                    <p>It was important for me to rethink about what “goals” means and start thinking about goals in one of two ways. To me, goals are either a system to build habits to achieve goals Ex. work out 4 times a week = healthier, more muscle tone, etc. Or, reverse engineering goal to long term, mid term, micro goals. Ex. Become fluent in Spanish is my long term goal. Go to madrid &amp; have a conversation in spanish is my medium term goal 4&#8211;8 months, and take a spanish class is my short term 1&#8211;2 month goal). It’s important to think of new short term goals each time you complete your current short term goal, so that you can keep iteratively making progress!</p> 

                    <p>Taking large tasks and breaking them down into medium and small taks is a fundamental pillar of agile process. Agile process takes advantage of doing incremental work through the lifecycle of a task instead of trying to complete the task all at once. Being agile in goal completion is just as important because life happens.</p>

                    <p>Essentially, the idea is to take a large problem that seems difficult and break it down to smaller problems to solve. There&#8217;s something nice about hitting psychological milestones, even if they&#8217;re arbitrary and just ones you make up.</p>

                    <p>As with an individual goal being broken down into smaller parts, I also try to break my list of goals up into different categories to think about. My categories are: “Work, Health, Family/Friends, Personal&quot;. </p>

                    <p>I chose them as a personal tailoring of a psychology theory called “the four burners”. If you’re not familiar with it:</p>

                    <p>“Imagine that your life is represented by a stove with four burners on it. Each burner symbolizes one major quadrant of your life.</p>

                    <ol>
                    <li>The first burner represents your family.</li>
                    <li>The second burner is your friends.</li>
                    <li>The third burner is your health.</li>
                    <li>The fourth burner is your work.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The Four Burners Theory says that “in order to be successful you have to cut off one of your burners. And in order to be really successful you have to cut off two.”

                    <p>I tailored the four burners and combined family &amp; friends because I subscribe to the belief that your friends are your family just the ones you get to choose (and because I don’t have a significant other / children so this makes it easy). I also place a lot of value in self actualization, so personal goals are things that will help me become more well rounded and hopefully sustainably happy. </p>

                    <p>The four categories helps me to zoom out a bit when setting goals to really think about what is important to me. Right now. This year. </p>

                    <p>For example, if I list all my goals and see that I have 6 goals in work &amp; 0 in health, it forces me to internally think if that is a true reflection of my wants/desires/needs and if it aligns with my moral principles. Zero in health would be a red flag.</p>

                    <p>I try to set 3&#8211;4 goals per category. </p>
