                    <p>At the beginning of this year, I only wanted to focus on the future and plan on how I'd continue to improve. <a href="https://graysonpaulcooper.com/how-to-set-goals-2018" title="graysonpaulcooper.com/how-to-set-goals-2018" alt="graysonpaulcooper.com/how-to-set-goals-2018">(I wrote about those things here).</a> Until a bit ago I read Tomas Laurinavicius' email about his year in review. In his email, he lists the top 10 successes, failures, lessons, songs, books, etc. It was an interesting email and so I forwarded it to a good friend of mine, Forrest.</p>
                    
                    <p>After Forrest read it, he texted me and said, &#8220;Thanks so much for sending me that email. I read it then thought about all the things that I did in 2017 and I am really happy about who I am today.&#8221;</p>

                    <p>His text inspired me to do it for myself. After going through the exercise of listing these out, it magnified how much I got done in a year (AND how much I can potentially get done in the next). Here are my top 10 successes, failures, books, songs, and lessons from 2017.</p>

                    <h3>In 2017, I suceeded at&#8230;</h3>

                    <h3>I I learned a deeper meaning of these lessons..</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Wherever you go, there you are.</li>
                        <li>Optimism is a choice (a fucking hard choice sometimes).</li>
                        <li>Who you spend time with influences your behaviors and thoughts.</li>
                        <li>You are a product of your thoughts.</li>
                        <li>You can pour your heart into something and it still not pan out.</li>
                        <li>Working smarter is better than working hard, but working hard is a good thing most of the time.</li>
                        <li>If you believe in yourself and act confident, you're most of the way there.</li>
                        <li>If you love, do it with all your heart.</li>
                        <li>Make self development a priority.</li>
                        <li>Think long term.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>I am happier now than I was at the beginning of 2017. This exercise helped remind me how grateful I am to be where I am now. If you're looking for an activity to make you grateful, try this one!</p>
